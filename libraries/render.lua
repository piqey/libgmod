end

--- Sets up the ambient lighting for any upcoming render operation. Ambient lighting can be seen as a cube enclosing the object to be drawn, each of its faces representing a directional light source that shines towards the object. Thus, there is a total of six different light sources that can be configured separately.  
--- Light color components are not restricted to a specific range (i.e. 0-255), instead, higher values will result in a brighter light.

function render.SetShadowDistance(shadowDistance)
end

--- Sets whether any future render operations will ignore shadow drawing.  
--- @param newState boolean 
function render.SetShadowsDisabled(newState)
end

--- Sets the compare function of the stencil.  
--- Pixels which fail the stencil comparison function are not written to the render target. The operation to be performed on the stencil buffer values for these pixels can be set using render.SetStencilFailOperation.  
--- Pixels which pass the stencil comparison function are written to the render target unless they fail the depth buffer test (where applicable). The operation to perform on the stencil buffer values for these pixels can be set using render.SetStencilPassOperation and render.SetStencilZFailOperation.  
--- @param compareFunction number @Compare function, see Enums/STENCILCOMPARISONFUNCTION, and Enums/STENCIL for short.
function render.SetStencilCompareFunction(compareFunction)
end

--- Sets whether stencil tests are carried out for each rendered pixel.  
--- Only pixels passing the stencil test are written to the render target.  
--- @param newState boolean @The new state.
function render.SetStencilEnable(newState)
end

--- Sets the operation to be performed on the stencil buffer values if the compare function was not successful.  
--- Note that this takes place **before** depth testing.  
--- @param failOperation number @Fail operation function, see Enums/STENCILOPERATION
function render.SetStencilFailOperation(failOperation)
end

--- Sets the operation to be performed on the stencil buffer values if the compare function was successful.  
--- @param passOperation number @Pass operation function, see Enums/STENCILOPERATION
function render.SetStencilPassOperation(passOperation)
end

--- Sets the reference value which will be used for all stencil operations. This is an unsigned integer.  
--- @param referenceValue number @Reference value.
function render.SetStencilReferenceValue(referenceValue)
end

--- Sets the unsigned 8-bit test bitflag mask to be used for any stencil testing.  
--- @param mask number @The mask bitflag.
function render.SetStencilTestMask(mask)
end

--- Sets the unsigned 8-bit write bitflag mask to be used for any writes to the stencil buffer.  
--- @param mask number @The mask bitflag.

function render.SetStencilZFailOperation(zFailOperation)
end

--- @param vec GVector 
function render.SetToneMappingScaleLinear(vec)

--- Changes the view port position and size. The values will be clamped to the game's screen resolution.  
--- If you are looking to render something to a texture (render target), you should use render.PushRenderTarget.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function will override values of Global.ScrW and Global.ScrH with the ones you set.  
--- @param x number @X origin of the view port.
--- @param y number @Y origin of the view port.
--- @param w number @Width of the view port.

function render.SetViewPort(x, y, w, h)
end

--- Sets the internal parameter **INT_RENDERPARM_WRITE_DEPTH_TO_DESTALPHA**  
--- @param enable boolean 
function render.SetWriteDepthToDestAlpha(enable)
end

--- Swaps the frame buffers/cycles the frame. In other words, this updates the screen.  
--- If you take a really long time during a single frame render, it is a good idea to use this and let the user know that the game isn't stuck.  
function render.Spin()

--- Start a new beam draw operation.  
--- ðŸ§± **NOTE**: Requires a 3D rendering context  
--- @param segmentCount number @Amount of beam segments that are about to be drawn.

--- Returns if the current settings and the system allow the usage of pixel shaders 1.4.  
--- @return boolean @Whether Pixel Shaders 1.4 are supported or not.

--- Updates the power of two texture.  
--- @return GITexture @Returns render.GetPowerOfTwoTexture.
function render.UpdatePowerOfTwoTexture()
end

--- Pretty much alias of render.UpdatePowerOfTwoTexture but does not return the texture.  
function render.UpdateRefractTexture()
end

--- Copies the entire screen to the screen effect texture, which can be acquired via render.GetScreenEffectTexture. This function is mainly intended to be used in GM:RenderScreenspaceEffects
