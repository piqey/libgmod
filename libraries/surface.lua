--- The surface library allows you to draw text and shapes on the screen. Primarily used for making HUDs & custom GUI panels.  
_G.surface = {}
--- Creates a new font.  
--- To prevent the font from displaying incorrectly when using the "outline" setting, set "antialias" to false. This will ensure the text properly fills out the entire outline.  
--- Be sure to check the List of Default Fonts first! Those fonts can be used without using this function.  
--- See Also: Finding the Font Name.  
--- âš  **WARNING**: Due to the static nature of fonts, do **NOT** create the font more than once. You should only be creating them once, it is recommended to create them at the top of your script. Do not use this function within GM:HUDPaint or any other hook!  
--- âš  **WARNING**: Define fonts that you will actually use, as fonts are very taxing on performance and will cause crashes! Do not create fonts for every size.  
--- @param fontName string @The new font name.
--- @param fontData table @The font properties
function surface.CreateFont(fontName, fontData)
end

--- ðŸ›‘ **DEPRECATED**:   
--- Alias of Global.DisableClipping so use that instead.  
--- Enables or disables the clipping used by the VGUI that limits the drawing operations to a panels bounds.  
--- Identical to Global.DisableClipping. See also Panel:NoClipping.  
--- @param disable boolean @True to disable, false to enable the clipping
function surface.DisableClipping(disable)
end

--- @param originX number @The center x integer coordinate.
--- @param originY number @The center y integer coordinate.
--- @param radius number @The radius of the circle.
--- @param r number @The red value of the color to draw the circle with, or a Color.

function surface.DrawOutlinedRect(x, y, w, h)
end

--- Draws a textured polygon (secretly a triangle fan) with a maximum of 256 vertices.  
--- Only works properly with convex polygons. You may try to render concave polygons, but there is no guarantee that things wont get messed up.  
--- Unlike most surface library functions, non-integer coordinates are not rounded.  
--- âš  **WARNING**: You must reset the drawing color and texture before calling the function to ensure consistent results. See examples below.  
--- ðŸŸ¥ **NOTE**: Requires a 2D rendering context  
--- @param vertices table @A table containing integer vertices
function surface.DrawPoly(vertices)

--- @param height number @The integer height of the rectangle.
function surface.DrawRect(x, y, width, height)
end

--- Draw the specified text on the screen, using the previously set position, font and color.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function does not handle newlines properly  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function sets new text position at the end of the previous drawn text length - this can be used to change text properties (such as font or color) without recalculating and resetting text position. See example #2 for example use of this behavior.  
--- ðŸŸ¥ **NOTE**: Requires a 2D rendering context  
--- @param text string @The text to be rendered.
function surface.DrawText(text)
end

--- Draw a textured rectangle with the given position and dimensions on the screen, using the current active texture set with surface.SetMaterial. It is also affected by surface.SetDrawColor.  
--- See also render.SetMaterial and render.DrawScreenQuadEx.

--- @param rotation number @The rotation of the rectangle, in degrees.
function surface.DrawTexturedRectRotated(x, y, width, height, rotation)
end

--- Draws a textured rectangle with a repeated or partial texture.  
--- u and v refer to texture coordinates.  
--- * (u, v) = (0, 0) is the top left  
--- * (u, v) = (1, 0) is the top right  
--- * (u, v) = (1, 1) is the bottom right  
--- * (u, v) = (0, 1) is the bottom left  
--- Using a start point of (1, 0) and an end point to (0, 1), you can draw an image flipped horizontally, same goes with other directions. Going above 1 will tile the texture. Negative values are allowed as well.  
--- Here's a helper image:  
--- <upload src="70c/8d7bba248dc08bd.png" size="183359" name="image.png">  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: If you are using a .png image, you need supply the "noclamp" flag as second parameter for Global.Material if you intend to use tiling.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: If you find that surface.DrawTexturedRectUV is getting your texture coordinates (u0, v0), (u1, v1) wrong and you're rendering with a material created with Global.CreateMaterial, try adjusting them with the following code:  
--- ```  
--- local du = 0.5 / 32 -- half pixel anticorrection  
--- local dv = 0.5 / 32 -- half pixel anticorrection  
--- local u0, v0 = (u0 - du) / (1 - 2 * du), (v0 - dv) / (1 - 2 * dv)  
--- local u1, v1 = (u1 - du) / (1 - 2 * du), (v1 - dv) / (1 - 2 * dv)  
--- ```  
--- **Explanation:**  
--- surface.DrawTexturedRectUV tries to correct the texture coordinates by half a pixel (something to do with sampling) and computes the correction using IMaterial::GetMappingWidth()/GetMappingHeight(). If the material was created without a $basetexture, then GetMappingWidth()/GetMappingHeight() uses the width and height of the error material (which is 32x32).  
--- ðŸŸ¥ **NOTE**: Requires a 2D rendering context  
--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [The UV offsets might require (sub-)pixel correction for accurate tiling results.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/3173)
